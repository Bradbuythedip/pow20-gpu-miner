# CUDA Optimization Guide for SHA256 Hashing

This guide provides an overview of optimization strategies that can be applied to your CUDA kernel for SHA256 hashing to potentially improve performance.

## Optimization Techniques

- **Maximizing Warp Utilization:** Ensure that the number of active warps per multiprocessor is maximized to fully utilize the GPU's computing resources.

- **Memory Optimization:** Minimize global memory accesses and maximize the use of shared and register memory to reduce memory latency.

- **Loop Unrolling:** Exploit loop unrolling to enhance parallelism and reduce execution time for loops within your kernel.

- **Occupancy:** Aim for higher occupancy but be aware of diminishing returns. Occupancy is a measure of how well the GPU compute resources are utilized.

- **Vectorized Data Types:** Use vectorized data types to reduce the number of memory transactions.
