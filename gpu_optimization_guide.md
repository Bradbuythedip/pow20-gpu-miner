# GPU Optimization Guide for Rust-based Crypto Mining

This guide outlines the steps needed to transition the CPU-based mining script to leverage GPU capabilities for increased efficiency and profitability.

## Step 1: Employ `rust-gpu` and `wgpu`
Use the `rust-gpu` crate for CUDA integration and `wgpu` for cross-platform GPU compute tasks. These libraries facilitate writing Rust code that runs on the GPU, crucial for optimizing the SHA256 hashing process.

## Step 2: Adapt Hashing to GPU
Modify the existing SHA256 hashing function to utilize GPU acceleration. This involves leveraging the computational power of the GPU for faster processing of hashes, significantly speeding up the mining process.

## Step 3: Integrate and Test
Integrate the GPU-based hashing logic into the existing script while ensuring other functionalities, like network requests and result submission, continue to work seamlessly. Test the modified script extensively to ensure stability and correctness.

## Step 4: Validation and Performance Tuning
After successful integration and testing, validate the correctness of the hash outputs. Subsequently, perform performance tuning to achieve an optimal balance between power consumption and hash rate.

By following these steps, your mining operation can potentially see a significant improvement in efficiency and profitability with minimal additional power consumption.
